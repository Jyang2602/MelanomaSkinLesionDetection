# MelanomaSkinLesionDetection
Explored application of ResNet, AlexNet, and VGG on skin lesion classification. 

Using the ISIC2018 Dataset of 10015 training images and 168 validation images, we trained three base models on the data to classify skin lesions of seven categories. We adjust the amount of training samples; we train on learned weights from ImageNet; we visualize model outputs, and we find the most commonly misclassified skin lesions in this project.
